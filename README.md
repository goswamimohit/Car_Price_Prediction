# Car_Price_Prediction
with help of random forest regression

1. MPG or miles per gallon : It is the distance, measured in miles, that a car can travel per gallon of fuel 
    
2. City MPG: the score a car will get on average in city conditions, with stopping and starting at lower speeds.
3. wheelbase : wheelbase of any vehicle is the distance between the centre of the front wheels and the centre of the rear wheels.
        
    1.Cars with long wheelbases tend to have better ride quality than those with short wheelbases. 
    
    2.This is simply because there's more time between the front and rear wheels hitting any bumps, so the car is less likely to become unsettled
    
    3.Short wheelbase cars are better for nipping around town and more fun on twisty roads
    
    
4. Highway MPG: the average a car will get while driving on an open stretch of road without stopping or starting, typically at a higher speed.
    
5. compression ratio A higher compression ratio (CR) is beneficial for engines. That's because the higher ratio allows for an engine to extract more energy from the combustion process due to better thermal efficiency
    
6. Horsepower (hp) : Horsepower (hp) is the metric used to indicate the power produced by a car's engine - the higher the number, the more power is sent to the wheels and, in theory, the faster it will go


Results & Conclusion :
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Accuracy of model : 89.26 %

  Feels pretty good.

  But not final one.

  Need to work on:

    1. outliers
    2. standisation
    3. experimenting with more features
    4. deploying other type of models
